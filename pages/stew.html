    <ul class="list">
        <li>The Freshly Slain Carcass Of A Rare Three Toed Elk</li>
        <li>You Need None Else</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="smallheading">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Prepare a hunting band of trusted men and venture deep into the forest where light fades from thick canopy cover</li>
        <li>Spend days tracking and stalking the rare three toed elk</li>
        <li>Prepare your traps to ensnare your target</li>
        <li>Enter into a life and death struggle with the elk, and when weapons prove meaningless, resort to bare fists and wrestle the creature</li>
        <li>Once all hope is fading and victory seems far, call "ODIN" and he will appear</li>
        <li>Roast on an open flame and enjoy with comrades. After all you've been through, stew would take too much time to make</li>
    </ol>
