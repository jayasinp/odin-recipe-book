    <h1>VALHALLA STEW</h1>
    <img src="/images/stew.jpeg" alt="The Stew They Serve In Valhalla">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Freshly Slain Carcass Of A Rare Three Toed Elk</li>
        <li>You Need None Else</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a hunting band of trusted men and venture deep into the forest where light fades from thick canopy cover</li>
        <li>Spend days tracking and stalking the rare three toed elk</li>
        <li>Prepare your traps to ensnare your target</li>
        <li>Enter into a life and death struggle with the elk, and when weapons prove meaningless, resort to bare fists and wrestle the creature</li>
        <li>Once all hope is fading and victory seems far, call "ODIN" and he will appear</li>
        <li>Roast on an open flame and enjoy with comrades. After all you've been through, stew would take too much time to make</li>
    </ol>
